## JavaScript outside of the Browser

So far we have only used JavaScript in the browser. But JavaScript can also be used outside of the browser.

Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript. It allows us to run JavaScript outside of the browser. Node.js has some differences to the browser. For example, Node.js does not have a DOM. But it provides some APIs that are not available in the browser. For example, Node.js provides an API to access the file system.

One thing that Node.js can do is to create a web server. A web server is a program that listens for requests and sends responses back to the client. The web server can be used to serve web pages or to provide an API for a web application.

## Running a Node Program

To run a Node program you need to use the `node` command. The `node` command takes the path to a JavaScript file as an argument. The following `node` command will execute the JavaScript file `index.js` in the root of the project: `node index.js`.

For convenience, our templates include a script in the package.json that allows you to run the program with **`npm run start`**. The template includes a development mode, that automatically restarts the program when you make changes to the code. To start the development mode you can use **`npm run dev`**. Take a look at the `package.json` file to see how the scripts are defined.

## A Basic Node.js Program

A Node.js program can be almost anything. It can be a web server, a command line tool or a script that does some calculations. Try out to create a Node.js program that prints "Hello World" to the console or does some calculations.

```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

```js
const answer = 32 + 4;
console.log(answer);
```

Run the program with the `node` command. For example, if you save the program in a file called `index.js` you can run the program with `node index.js`.

> ðŸ’¡ You can use the `console.log` function to print values to the console. In the case of Node.js the console is the terminal and not the browser console.

## Node.js Servers

You can use Node.js to create web servers. To do so you can use the `http` module provided by Node.js.

You can import a native node module by using the `node:` prefix. For example, to import the `http` module you can use the following code:

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";
```

You don't need to install the `http` module. It is included in Node.js.

### Creating a Server

The `http` module provides a function called `createServer` that takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is called whenever a request is made to the server. The callback function is called with two arguments: `request` and `response`. The `request` object contains information about the request that was made to the server. The `response` object is used to send a response back to the client.

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";

export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
  response.statusCode = 200;
  response.end("Hello World");
});
```

The `response.statusCode` property is used to set the status code of the response. The `response.end` method takes a string as an argument. The string is sent back to the client.

You can access the `request` object to get information about the request that was made to the server. For example, you can access the `url` property of the `request` object to get the URL that was requested.

```js
import { createServer } from "node:http";

export const server = createServer((request, response) => {
  if (request.url === "/") {
    response.statusCode = 200;
    response.end("Hello World");
  } else {
    response.statusCode = 404;
    response.end("Not Found");
  }
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ Online you will find the abbreviations `req` and `res` for `request` and `response`. This is a common convention but `req` and `res` are very hard to distinguish so we will use the full names in this bootcamp.

### Starting the Server (Listening for Requests)

To start the server you need to call the `listen` method on the server object. The `listen` method takes two arguments: the port number and an optional callback function. The callback function is called when the server is ready to accept requests.

To separate the code that creates the server from the code that starts the server you can export the server object from a `server.js` file and start the server in `index.js`:

```js
// index.js
import { server } from "./server.js";

const port = 8000;
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://127.0.0.1:${port}/`);
});
```

> ðŸ’¡ When you call `listen`, Node.js will keep the program running instead of exiting immediately. This is necessary because the program needs to keep running in order to accept requests.

## Serverless functions

There are different approaches to creating backend functions for web applications.

A traditional web server for example built with the Node.js framework Express is a program running on a server or virtual machine that listens for incoming HTTP requests - like a waiter at a restaurant waiting for customers to place their orders. The code for the Express server is typically written in a so called monolithic structure, where all the different functions and endpoints are managed by the same program.

On the other hand Serverless Functions are like little helpers that are only executed on-demand, i.e. when they are needed. They wait for specific things to happen, like when a web applications gets a HTTP request or when a database gets updated. When that happens, the serverless function runs its code to do the specific job it was programmed to do and is terminated afterwards.
Serverless cloud provider, like Vercel, take care of all the details like setting up the computer resources needed to run the code and shutting them down when the job is done. It's like having a team of chefs come into the kitchen, cook a dish, and then clean everything up when they are finished. This makes it easier for developers to write code without having to worry about managing servers or resources.

## What a server-side API is meant for

As we already learned in the JS Fetch session an API (Application Programming Interface) can be seen from different perspectives and occur on various levels.

APIs running on a server environment are called server-side APIs. They are provided by a _server_, opposing to the APIs provided by the browser (which is also called the _client_). A common use-case for such server-side APIs is to create, read, update and delete data; so called CRUD operations.

> ðŸ’¡ Take a look at handout of the JS Fetch Session to refresh your knowledge of APIs.

## Next.js API routes

Our main goal is to build a database and to handle its data in our web application. To do this we have to create our own API routes inside of the web application and decide what information and data the routes return. Luckily, Next.js provides us with a cool feature using simple and intuitive syntax.

It follows a simple folder structure: Any file inside the folder e.g. `pages/api/test/file.js` is mapped to the respective url with the same path e.g. `/api/test/file` and will be treated as an API endpoint instead of a page.

In Next.js, an API route is simply a JavaScript module that exports a default function. For example, a file called `pages/api/hello.js` creates the API endpoint `/api/hello` that responds with a JSON message of "Hello Web Developer!". The handler function takes two arguments: a request object and a response object, which are used to start the serverless program on vercel and handle incoming requests and send responses back to the client.

```js
export default function handler(request, response) {
  response.status(200).json({ message: "Hello Web Developer!" });
}
```

### Dynamic API Routes

Next.js supports Dynamic API Routes to create API endpoints that can handle dynamic parameters in the URL path and follows the same file naming rules used for pages.

For example, if you want to create an API endpoint that can handle requests for individual jokes, you could create a file called `/pages/api/jokes/[id].js`. This creates a dynamic API route where the id parameter can be any value. If you want to get a single joke, depending on the jokes `id` used in the browser route, we can acess the `id` route parameter by destructuring it from `request.query` object.

```js
export default function handler(request, response) {
  const { id } = request.query;
  //...
}
```

## How to log/debug with `console.log()`

You can use the `console.log()` function to debug your web application and understand what is happening within your API Routes. Since the API handlers are executed on the server, the console output will be displayed in your terminal (localhost) where you started the development server (`npm run dev`) or in the Vercel web interface (vercel deployment).
